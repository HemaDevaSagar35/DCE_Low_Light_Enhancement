1) Training: Look for the training script train_model.py
2) Inference: Look for the inferency script inference.py
3) Most of these scripts can be run in other environments with few tweaks
4) For the dataset refer to here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HiLtYiyT9R7dR9DRTLRlUUrAicC4zzWN/view
5) Find the stable model under models
